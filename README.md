Steps to Train
1) Download the MIMIC-CXR dataset from https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/, and setup the dataset and relevant paths in the code
2) Process the radiology reports using MISTRAL-7B model 
3) Pre-process the data, remove noisy data points in the reports, and perform similarity removal of concepts
4) Train the model
